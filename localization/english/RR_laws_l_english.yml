 law_informal_authority:0 "Informal Authority"
 law_informal_authority_desc:0 "The state capital has nominal authority on the country, but its ability to project that authority effectively ends at the borders of the city center. The hierarchy of power in the rest of the country is completely informal, relying instead on the ruler's ability to identify local leaders and on their willingness to cooperate with their commands."
 law_feudalism:0 "Feudalism"
 law_feudalism_desc:0 "Feudalism is a system of devolved governance style where specific individuals are determined the landowners of provinces, all of which are held in personal loyalty to the head of state for the whole nation. A somewhat decentralized model, Feudalism results in strong local governments formed around an aristocracy and greatly strengthens landholder political power. This allows more authoritative actions, but the populace will know who is responsible for poor quality of life"
 law_unitary:0 "Unitary"
 law_unitary_desc:0 "A unitary state is one where all regions of the state are governed essentially the same, and have little to no regional variance or specific representation.

 law_military_cantons:0 "Military Cantons"
 law_military_cantons_desc:0 "Localities organized by military administration, which is nominally subordinate to the central state. Each canton organizes itself according to its needs while facilitating compliance to authority. The more governance is styled in accordance to military in response to an external threat, it is not difficult to find internal threats too. Likewise, if standard of living declines under this governance model, what use is the army to protect people when the government can't provide food?"
 law_federalism:0 "Federalism"
 law_federalism_desc:0 "Federalism diffuses the power of the central government - often utilizing a system of regional representation to each state, allowing them to conduct internal policy often by using residual powers. Tax income does not always reach the national treasury, as tax funding is often split between national and state bodies - as well as funding initiatives and grants provided by the state. The diffused powers ease administration of population, and the state governments can take care of their internal commerce. This facilitating of connections to markets along with local infastructure eases the burden on the central authority. Consequently, locals tend to feel empowered under this system, and are less keen to seek violent change within the state."
 law_confederation:0 "Confederation"
 law_confederation_desc:0 "Confederation is an extremely decentralized system which gives local regions not only autonomous control over economic and political policy, but even a degree of military autonomy through milita organisations. This can be considered as an exagerated diffusion of power compared to federalism - under this system the provinces are nominally united under the central government and coalition-building is commonplace. Participation in provincial militias ensures a sense of community, security and safety."

In short, there is no standardized model to conduct urban planning and industrial economic development in the state. This society is completely unprepared for an industrial & urban future. As a conseqence: urbanization like this leads to large sprawling favelas and slums that are exceptionally difficult to tax or organize.

 law_guild_system:0 "Guild System"
 law_guild_system_desc:0 "A guild system is a method of urban development largely spearheaded by organizations of wealthy businessmen, who themselves are largely patronized by old monied aristocrats.

 law_titled_estates:0 "Titled Estates"
 law_titled_estates_desc:0 "A distribution of land largely bound into massive sprawling complexes owned by single individuals and transferred herditarily rather than by sale on the market.

 law_slave_economy:0 "Slave Economy"
 law_slave_economy_desc:0 "A peculiar institution in which production is largely performed by unpaid laborers, who are forced to work especially long and dangerous hours on plantations to produce a greater profit.
