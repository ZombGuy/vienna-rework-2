 commierev.5.d:0 "The workers of [SCOPE.sState('coop_state').GetName] passed a new Workers' Democratic Management Act with a high vote in the Workers' Council of [SCOPE.sBuilding('coop_building').GetName], aiming to promote mass technological innovation, amend unreasonable regulations, and ensure workers' management rights over the enterprise."
 commierev.5.f:0 "In the past, bureaucrats formulated production plans in such a way that the indicators went down, causing difficulties for cadres while the masses watched. Last year, the workers and masses discussed plans from bottom to top with a high sense of ownership and responsibility. Based on the actual situation, they not only fully unleashed revolutionary enthusiasm but also left room for improvement. As a result, the annual production task was completed ahead of schedule. The working class has mastered the management power of enterprises and fully unleashed the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses."
